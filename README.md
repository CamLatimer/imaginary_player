# IMAGINARY PLAYER

This is an exercise with AJAX, Angular, SASS, and Gulp.  At some point, I might try out PostCSS with it also.  

This is a site that will use the SoundCloud API to...
* Search SC for individual tracks
* Play a track from that search page
* Link users to a separate view page for a selected song where there will be...
  * a player widget I made / customized
  * info for the track -- title, user who posted, comments, etc
  * animated comments
  * some kind of visualization graphic / chart for the track's info
